# Password-Generator

## Description
I wanted to fix broken code in this JavaScript document to create a random password generator that could be used to create great passwords. This project allows anyone who uses it the ability to create a randomly generated password that includes lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers. I learned how to combine multiple arrays into one, how to properly use if else statements, how to use for loops, how to return responses from for loops, how to use variables throughout JavaScript to get the desired outcome, and how to imbed functions.

## Usage
To use this password generator click the generate password button. You will then be asked a few questions in JavaScript prompts. Answer each of these in order to define the chracteristics of your password. At the end you will be given a password that fits the criteria you selected when you answered the prompts.
