# Password-Generator

## Description
I wanted to fix broken code in this JavaScript document to create a random password generator that could be used to create great passwords. This project allows anyone who uses it the ability to create a randomly generated password that includes lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers. I learned how to combine multiple arrays into one, how to properly use if else statements, how to use for loops, and how to imbed functions.

## Usage
To use this password generator click the generate password button. You will then be asked a few questions in JavaScript prompts. Answer each of these in order to define the chracteristics of your password. At the end you will be given a password that fits the criteria you selected when you answered the prompts.
