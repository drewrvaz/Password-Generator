# Password-Generator

## Description
I wanted to fix broken code in this JavaScript document to create a random password generator that could be used to create great passwords. This project allows anyone who uses it the ability to create a randomly generated password that includes lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers. I learned how to combine multiple arrays into one, how to properly use if else statements, how to use for loops, and how to imbed functions.

## Usage
